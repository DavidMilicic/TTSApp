# TTSApp
TTS App project for school

Needed: Virtual audio cable to output audio to an app like Discord (https://vb-audio.com/Cable/)

I made this tts app so you can use it to talk with your friends without using your voice. 
Just simply select a voice you wish to use and set the output to CABLE Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable), set the input device in an app like Discord to Cable Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable). You should also set the Input mode to Voice Activity instead of Push to Talk so you can easily talk with your friends.
